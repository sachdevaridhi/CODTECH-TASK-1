DOMAIN: DATA ANALYTICS
DURATION: JUNE TO JULY 2024
MENTOR: G.SRAVANI

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to build a simple linear regression model to predict the 'Fare' of a passenger based on their 'Age' using the Titanic dataset.

**Steps Involved**
**Loading the Data:**

Import necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
Load the Titanic dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Explore the dataset to understand the structure, missing values, and distributions.
Visualize the data using scatter plots to identify the relationship between 'Age' and 'Fare.'
**Data Preprocessing:**

Handle missing values (e.g., fill with mean/median, drop rows/columns).
Select relevant columns for the prediction task.
**Splitting the Data:**

Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
**Building the Model:**

Use a linear regression algorithm to train the model on the training data.
**Evaluating the Model:**

Use evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared) to assess the model's performance on the test set.
Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values.
**Making Predictions:**

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
Compare predicted values with actual values to assess accuracy.
